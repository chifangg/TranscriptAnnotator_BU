      "\n",
      "5: [Chifang Chou] So, if you have any questions regarding the study, you can just interrupt me at any time, and I'll answer you directly.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "14: [Alex Marasigan] Um, nope.\n",
      "\n",
      "15: [Chifang Chou] Okay, then we'll go straight to the demo process, and I will show you what we need later. Let me share my screen one more time.\n",
      "\n",
      "16: [Chifang Chou] Can you see my screen right now? Yes, okay, so have you used ChatGPT before?\n",
      "\n",
      "17: [Alex Marasigan] Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "18: [Alex Marasigan] Um, yes, I have.\n",
      "\n",
      "19: [Chifang Chou] Okay, awesome. So later, what we're going to do is, uh, this is ChatGPT's interface, and we are going to upload the dataset that I will provide you later. So, the first step for you is to log in to ChatGPT with the account that I will provide later. And after that, you can drag in the dataset, for example, like this. I'll drag in directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "20: [Chifang Chou] Or you can use… also use the plus button here for uploading files, but it's up to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "21: [Chifang Chou] And then we will go back to the scenario file. I'll also provide you the scenario file as well, and what scenario file is, is that, um, basically it provides the, um.\n",
      "\n",
      "22: [Chifang Chou] Introduction, the dataset introduction, and three scenarios in your file. And for the introduction, it's a really short paragraph that just, um.\n",
      "\n",
      "23: [Chifang Chou] Kindly tell you that what are the information inside the dataset, and you can also feel free to open the CSV file yourself to observe it. You can do whatever you like.\n",
      "\n",
      "24: [Chifang Chou] And for the visualization scenario is the, um, top task here, is that you're going to read the paragraph here and put yourself in the scenario, and try to prompt ChatGPT to get the visualization in.\n",
      "\n",
      "25: [Chifang Chou] Uh, to fulfill this kind of scenario. So, for example, here, imagine you are a regional sales analysis about to brief your team. Use the data center to show which regions are performing well and which might need improvement. How would you visualize the differences in total sales and profit to make your story convincing?\n",
      "\n",
      "26: [Chifang Chou] So, for me, after I, um, read this scenario, after I put myself in the scenario, I'll start thinking, what's the important thing here to, um.\n",
      "\n",
      "27: [Chifang Chou] For me to visualize, so probably I'll prompt like this, um, please generate.\n",
      "\n",
      "28: [Chifang Chou] a visualization. Emphasizing… Um, total sales… And profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "29: [Chifang Chou] In, uh, different… regions. Yeah, so based on what I read, probably I would think that this is a good prompt to, um, throw into ChatGPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "30: [Chifang Chou] Then I would just send it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "31: [Chifang Chou] And then wait for its generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "32: [Chifang Chou] It might take a little while. Okay, so this is a chart that ChatGPT provided me. So, um, after that, after you, um, get the visualization and read maybe the context that ChatGPT provided you.\n",
      "\n",
      "33: [Alex Marasigan] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "34: [Chifang Chou] There are two ways that you can, um, go. First is that if you are not satisfied with the chart, you can keep prompting and keep asking ChatGPT to maybe improve the chart, to fix any problems you see from the chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "35: [Chifang Chou] Uh, if you're already satisfied with, um. the visualization that ChatGPT gave you. I will also give you a survey link, and you can go through the survey link directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "36: [Chifang Chou] And basically, the survey will look like this. Um, there's a page 1 that you need to, like, fill in your name, your email, and what dataset you use. This is page 2. So basically, after you get your IDO, which is.\n",
      "\n",
      "37: [Chifang Chou] The dry season that satisfy you. You can go ahead to put down 3 to 5 inside subject gain from the visualization.\n",
      "\n",
      "38: [Chifang Chou] So, the insights will be, like, um, the visualization you got, how can the visualization, um.\n",
      "\n",
      "39: [Chifang Chou] Answer the scenarios question. So, a lot of things can be the.\n",
      "\n",
      "40: [Chifang Chou] insights. So, for example, um, some participants from, um.\n",
      "\n",
      "41: [Chifang Chou] Using other data sets, they might have insights like this, for example, like x-axis and y-axis are, um, positive correlated, something like that. That can all be the insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "42: [Chifang Chou] And after the insights, you're going to fill in the, um… Scenario 1 survey, and after the survey, we'll have a really short interview about the answers you answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "43: [Chifang Chou] And then we will go on to the next scenario. So we'll, um, basically do it 3 times, and after that, we'll click the button right here, and then go on to the very final part of the assessments, or your self-assessment survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "44: [Chifang Chou] And then an interview again, and then that's the end of today's study.\n",
      "\n",
      "45: [Chifang Chou] If there are any questions regarding the study?\n",
      "\n",
      "46: [Alex Marasigan] Um, uh, not right now, no.\n",
      "\n",
      "47: [Chifang Chou] Okay, so, um… good, and I'm going to go ahead on sending you information regarding the account and your.\n",
      "\n",
      "48: [Chifang Chou] scenario files and the data set in the chat.\n",
      "\n",
      "49: [Chifang Chou] So, um, if you're ready, you can start sharing your screen, and we can go, um, the process together, step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "50: [Alex Marasigan] Um, okay, I sent a request to share my screen.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "52: [Alex Marasigan] Um… okay.\n",

      "53: [Alex Marasigan] Uh… and then I just go…\n",
      "\n",
      "54: [Chifang Chou] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "55: [Alex Marasigan] Here… oh, wait, no, I got a chat GPT.\n",

      "56: [Chifang Chou] Yeah, and… If you are…\n",
      "\n",
      "57: [Alex Marasigan] Oh, whoops.\n",
      "\n",
      "58: [Chifang Chou] Let's see…\n",

      "\n",
      "61: [Alex Marasigan] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "62: [Chifang Chou] Okay, sounds good. So, we can go ahead, um, you can download the.\n",
      "\n",
      "63: [Chifang Chou] dataset file from the chat as well, and open this, yeah, the scenario file.\n",
      "\n",
      "64: [Alex Marasigan] Hmm…\n",
      "\n",
      "65: [Alex Marasigan] Um…\n",
      "\n",
      "66: [Alex Marasigan] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "67: [Chifang Chou] So, if you see in the chat, there is a… dataset file. Is there anything wrong?\n",
      "\n",
      "68: [Alex Marasigan] Oh, wait, um…\n",
      "\n",
      "69: [Alex Marasigan] So… wait, is this the dataset?\n",
      "\n",
      "70: [Chifang Chou] Oh, no, this is the scenario file that you'll need to read later, so the dataset file is still in the chat that you can take a look again.\n",
      "\n",
      "71: [Alex Marasigan] Oh, okay, okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "72: [Chifang Chou] It is a CSV file that you need to download.\n",
      "\n",
      "73: [Chifang Chou] Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so, uh, by this, you can go back to the scenario file and start reading the, like, the introduction and the first scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "74: [Chifang Chou] And I'll leave you, like, 2 to 3 minutes, like, you can just, um, get the information from it, and whenever you're ready, we can start prompting.\n",
      "\n",
      "75: [Alex Marasigan] Uh, this is only this task 1, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "76: [Chifang Chou] Yeah, only task one. That's right.\n",
      "\n",
      "77: [Alex Marasigan] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "78: [Alex Marasigan] Hmm… am I allowed to open this?\n",
      "\n",
      "79: [Chifang Chou] Open where?\n",
      "\n",
      "80: [Alex Marasigan] Uh, to open this to see what, um…\n",
      "\n",
      "81: [Alex Marasigan] like, what data is inside here.\n",
      "\n",
      "82: [Chifang Chou] Of course, of course, you can do whatever you want to explore it, you can go ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "83: [Alex Marasigan] Okay, um…\n",
      "\n",
      "84: [Alex Marasigan] I just wanted to see what…\n",

      "86: [Alex Marasigan] that I have to… okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "87: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm, you can just, uh, explore whatever you want, just explore freely.\n",
      "\n",
      "88: [Alex Marasigan] Hmm…\n",

      "89: [Chifang Chou] And take your time, and just tell me whenever you're ready.\n",

      "\n",
      "91: [Alex Marasigan] determine, uh…\n",
      "\n",
      "92: [Alex Marasigan] how… or determine a prompt that would satisfy the…\n",

      "93: [Alex Marasigan] there… this really… or, like,\n",
      "\n",
      "94: [Alex Marasigan] is my job to figure out this relationship, or to generate something\n",
      "\n",
      "95: [Alex Marasigan] That will figure out their relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "96: [Chifang Chou] Um… the latter one, so you need… you will need to, like, generate a visualization. So basically, a graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "97: [Chifang Chou] To represent that scenario. Is that clear? Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "98: [Alex Marasigan] Okay, okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "99: [Alex Marasigan] Uh, am I only supposed to create one chart? Because it's asking for\n",
      "\n",
      "100: [Alex Marasigan] two relationships?\n",
      "\n",
      "101: [Chifang Chou] Um, yeah, only one, sorry.\n",

      "\n",
      "114: [Chifang Chou] And just a reminder that your ultimate goal is to get a visualization.\n",

      "115: [Alex Marasigan] Um, oh yeah, okay, okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "116: [Alex Marasigan] First responders.\n",

      "118: [Alex Marasigan] Okay, I mean, I think this is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "119: [Chifang Chou] Okay, so if you're, like, um, already satisfied with your chart, I can provide you the survey link right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "120: [Chifang Chou] I'll paste it in the chat.\n",
      "\n",
      "121: [Alex Marasigan] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "122: [Chifang Chou] Okay, so you can fill in this first.\n",
      "\n",
      "123: [Alex Marasigan] Um, what exactly am I supposed to describe here?\n",
      "\n",
      "124: [Chifang Chou] Um, so basically, um, can I take a look at your chart again?\n",
      "\n",
      "125: [Chifang Chou] Okay, so, um, there are a lot of things that you can describe about this chart that.\n",
      "\n",
      "126: [Chifang Chou] Okay, so personally, for me, I would probably say that in this chart, I can see that miles per gallon and horsepower are somehow, like, negative correlated.\n",
      "\n",
      "127: [Chifang Chou] But you don't need to do, like, what, exactly what I do, just.\n",
      "\n",
      "128: [Chifang Chou] You can write now whatever you want that you observe from this chart. And, for example, there is different color of car weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "129: [Chifang Chou] on different crosses, right? This can also be your insights, like, um, like, have your car weight will lead to, like, um, some better.\n",
      "\n",
      "130: [Alex Marasigan] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "131: [Chifang Chou] horsepower, or, um, higher miles per gallon, something like that, that's… those can all be your insights, so… Yeah, just feel free to… discovered it yourself, and you can all write it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "132: [Alex Marasigan] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "133: [Alex Marasigan] I have no idea how to describe this.\n",
      "\n",
      "134: [Alex Marasigan] Um…\n",
      "\n",
      "135: [Chifang Chou] It's going away.\n",
      "\n",
      "136: [Alex Marasigan] Like…\n",
      "\n",
      "137: [Alex Marasigan] Um, well, I obviously noticed that\n",
      "\n",
      "138: [Alex Marasigan] The lighter it is,\n",
      "\n",
      "139: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "140: [Alex Marasigan] Um, the ratio, uh, kind of…\n",
      "\n",
      "141: [Alex Marasigan] I guess it… it… it becomes more one-to-uh, one-to-one. Uh, maybe I'll just say that.\n",
      "\n",
      "142: [Chifang Chou] Yeah, don't worry about the phrasing or something, just… I think that it represents what you want to mean, then it's okay.\n",

      "\n",
      "145: [Chifang Chou] Okay, so, um, we have finished… The first scenario, right? Can you, um.\n",
      "\n",
      "146: [Chifang Chou] go back to the survey… For a little while, I will contact a really short interview. Okay, so, uh, for the insights, can you tell me that, um, how did you get those insights?\n",
      "\n",
      "147: [Alex Marasigan] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "148: [Alex Marasigan] Um…\n",
      "\n",
      "149: [Alex Marasigan] like, describe how… what I see on the chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "150: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "151: [Alex Marasigan] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "152: [Chifang Chou] Oh, I just… I'm sorry, I just… Once you do, like, talked about the insights that you just listed, just, you can just talk about.\n",
      "\n",
      "153: [Alex Marasigan] wrote to you. Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "154: [Chifang Chou] The insights that you got, yeah. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "155: [Alex Marasigan] Um, so…\n",
      "\n",
      "156: [Alex Marasigan] Well, like you mentioned in your example, um, I can see that it is going down, so it is\n",
      "\n",
      "157: [Alex Marasigan] negative cor… uh, negatively correlated.\n",
      "\n",
      "158: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "159: [Alex Marasigan] Um…\n",
      "\n",
      "160: [Alex Marasigan] Yeah, and then…\n",
      "\n",
      "161: [Alex Marasigan] Uh, as for how the car weight…\n",
      "\n",
      "162: [Alex Marasigan] Um, like, uh…\n",
      "\n",
      "163: [Alex Marasigan] influences the balance. Um, they're… the heavier, uh, based on this, uh, color,\n",
      "\n",
      "164: [Alex Marasigan] The heavier the car weight is,\n",
      "\n",
      "165: [Alex Marasigan] Uh, the more towards, uh, this side of the chart, it, uh, and then…\n",
      "\n",
      "166: [Alex Marasigan] the lighter it is, the more over here.\n",
      "\n",
      "167: [Alex Marasigan] Like, it is. So…\n",
      "\n",
      "168: [Alex Marasigan] Um, if it's…\n",
      "\n",
      "169: [Alex Marasigan] So, that basically means that the more\n",
      "\n",
      "170: [Alex Marasigan] Um, the more heavier it is,\n",
      "\n",
      "171: [Alex Marasigan] the less miles per gallon\n",
      "\n",
      "172: [Alex Marasigan] Uh, or the more horsepower there is per mat.\n",
      "\n",
      "173: [Alex Marasigan] per miles per gallon. Uh, and over here, it's more of, like, a one-to-one ratio, so, like, 50 is here, and 50 is, like, almost… so it's…\n",
      "\n",
      "174: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "175: [Alex Marasigan] almost, like, one-to-one, kind of.\n",
      "\n",
      "176: [Alex Marasigan] Um, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "177: [Chifang Chou] Okay, I see. Okay, then let's go back to the survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "178: [Chifang Chou] And then we, um, take a look at your answers. Can you scroll down a little bit? Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "179: [Chifang Chou] Um, so for the question that I do not, uh, feel the need to verify or double-check the AI-generated chart, you answer 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "180: [Chifang Chou] Which is that you feel like you. Uh, super need to verify and double check, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "181: [Chifang Chou] Can you tell me the reason for that and like.\n",
      "\n",
      "182: [Chifang Chou] Um, what made you feel that way?\n",
      "\n",
      "183: [Alex Marasigan] I mean, I… I always think it's…\n",
      "\n",
      "184: [Alex Marasigan] Even if, uh, this was, like, I made this.\n",
      "\n",
      "185: [Alex Marasigan] I feel like I… like, it's always good practice to, like, double check.\n",
      "\n",
      "186: [Alex Marasigan] Um, I feel like even more so for AI,\n",
      "\n",
      "187: [Alex Marasigan] Because, um, I mean, it doesn't…\n",
      "\n",
      "188: [Alex Marasigan] Uh, sometimes it doesn't, um, uh, get the accurate results.\n",
      "\n",
      "189: [Alex Marasigan] And that's, uh, just based off of my past experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "190: [Alex Marasigan] Um, with AI, um, in, uh, other stuff, so…\n",
      "\n",
      "191: [Alex Marasigan] like, um, I guess…\n",
      "\n",
      "192: [Alex Marasigan] uh, coding and, like, physics.\n",
      "\n",
      "193: [Alex Marasigan] Um, hasn't always given me, like, the right…\n",
      "\n",
      "194: [Alex Marasigan] answer. Um, so…\n",
      "\n",
      "195: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "196: [Alex Marasigan] I think it's just good practice to just check if\n",
      "\n",
      "197: [Alex Marasigan] Um, if the chart actually, um…\n",
      "\n",
      "198: [Alex Marasigan] like, displays… not because of, like,\n",
      "\n",
      "199: [Alex Marasigan] not because of anything, uh…\n",
      "\n",
      "200: [Alex Marasigan] like, in this prompt, or in this response that is, like,\n",
      "\n",
      "201: [Alex Marasigan] suspicious, but like…\n",
      "\n",
      "202: [Alex Marasigan] Um, it's just… it'd just be good to double check.\n",
      "\n",
      "203: [Chifang Chou] Okay, I see, and… Yeah, I guess it's… Okay, one more question that I'm confident in my own interpretation of the chart, answer 2 only.\n",
      "\n",
      "204: [Chifang Chou] Um, yeah, can you also share the reason for that?\n",
      "\n",
      "205: [Alex Marasigan] Um… well…\n",
      "\n",
      "206: [Alex Marasigan] I'm gonna be honest, I, uh, I only, like, skim the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "207: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "208: [Alex Marasigan] Um, I didn't…\n",
      "\n",
      "209: [Alex Marasigan] uh… I mean…\n",
      "\n",
      "210: [Alex Marasigan] I… I didn't collect this data.\n",
      "\n",
      "211: [Alex Marasigan] Um, it was… it was just…\n",
      "\n",
      "212: [Alex Marasigan] given to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "213: [Alex Marasigan] Um, and also, I'm not very…\n",
      "\n",
      "214: [Alex Marasigan] I'm not particularly confident.\n",
      "\n",
      "215: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "216: [Alex Marasigan] Um, in…\n",
      "\n",
      "217: [Alex Marasigan] Like, um…\n",
      "\n",
      "218: [Alex Marasigan] I don't know, like, statistics and stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "219: [Alex Marasigan] So… oh.\n",
      "\n",
      "220: [Chifang Chou] Oh, I see.\n",
      "\n",
      "221: [Alex Marasigan] For me, personally, like,\n",
      "\n",
      "222: [Alex Marasigan] I think it'd be nice to, like,\n",
      "\n",
      "223: [Alex Marasigan] Um…\n",
      "\n",
      "224: [Alex Marasigan] I… I don't know, I just don't really, um… I'm not really strong in statistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "225: [Alex Marasigan] Um, so, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "226: [Chifang Chou] Okay, I see. Okay, then I guess we can move on to the second scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "227: [Chifang Chou] And for the second scenario, please open a new chat, uh, traffic ChatGPT for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "228: [Chifang Chou] And also the same process, just new chat and.\n",
      "\n",
      "229: [Chifang Chou] Um, upload the data set again.\n",
      "\n",
      "230: [Alex Marasigan] Um, the new data?\n",
      "\n",
      "231: [Chifang Chou] Oh, no, the same one. The scenarios are based on the same data set for all these 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "232: [Alex Marasigan] Oh, okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "233: [Alex Marasigan] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "234: [Alex Marasigan] Um…\n",
      "\n",
      "235: [Alex Marasigan] I'm not quite sure how to determine fuel deficiency. Or, I mean, uh, inefficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "236: [Alex Marasigan] Should I ask, uh, the…\n",
      "\n",
      "237: [Alex Marasigan] AI, or can I Google it?\n",
      "\n",
      "238: [Chifang Chou] Um…\n",
      "\n",
      "239: [Alex Marasigan] Or should I just include it in the prompt?\n",
      "\n",
      "240: [Chifang Chou] Um, so…\n",
      "\n",
      "241: [Chifang Chou] Let me… wait, let me… let me check for a little while.\n",
      "\n",
      "242: [Chifang Chou] Okay, so basically, um… Because, um, the scenarios are made from the data set itself, so I believe that you can.\n",
      "\n",
      "243: [Chifang Chou] Um, prompted directly to get that, but, um. Uh… yeah, because, uh… As, uh, in the scenario, fuel efficiency is actually can be calculated in the.\n",
      "\n",
      "244: [Chifang Chou] table of the dataset, so. Yeah, I think you can just prompt directly by your intuition.\n",
      "\n",
      "245: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "246: [Chifang Chou] And just a reminder, again, that what you need is a visualization, so… It's okay, you can freeze the next thing, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "247: [Alex Marasigan] Oops.\n",
      "\n",
      "248: [Chifang Chou] Okay, we can keep going and just tell me whenever you're ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "249: [Alex Marasigan] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "250: [Alex Marasigan] Wait, what?\n",
      "\n",
      "251: [Chifang Chou] It's okay, take your time.\n",
      "\n",
      "252: [Alex Marasigan] Okay, um…\n",
      "\n",
      "253: [Alex Marasigan] Uh… I don't… I can type.\n",
      "\n",
      "254: [Alex Marasigan] Oh, okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "255: [Chifang Chou] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "256: [Alex Marasigan] Wait, um…\n",
      "\n",
      "257: [Chifang Chou] Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "258: [Alex Marasigan] Different model years?\n",
      "\n",
      "259: [Alex Marasigan] Wait, what does that mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "260: [Chifang Chou] Different model years? Let me check the dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "261: [Chifang Chou] In different model years means there is a column of year, right? You can see that, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "262: [Alex Marasigan] Um, yeah. Is it just…\n",
      "\n",
      "263: [Chifang Chou] Uh, model years, uh, actually represented to the year here, and the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "264: [Chifang Chou] Means the origin here. As you can see in the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "265: [Chifang Chou] Or you can say that that's closely related to.\n",
      "\n",
      "266: [Chifang Chou] The scenario that we want, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "267: [Alex Marasigan] So, it has nothing to do with the actual model.\n",
      "\n",
      "268: [Chifang Chou] Um… Actually, it depends on what you think, but you can say that as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "269: [Chifang Chou] But that's why, like. We're doing this kind of user study because we want to know how you guys will, like, interpret.\n",
      "\n",
      "270: [Chifang Chou] the scenario and the data as well, so. Mm-hmm, just… Yeah, just feel free to, like, generate what you think.\n",
      "\n",
      "271: [Alex Marasigan] Okay, so it's my interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "272: [Alex Marasigan] Okay, um…\n",
      "\n",
      "273: [Alex Marasigan] Well\n",
      "\n",
      "274: [Alex Marasigan] different model years.\n",
      "\n",
      "275: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "276: [Alex Marasigan] I used my interpretation is that it'll show a relationship\n",
      "\n",
      "277: [Alex Marasigan] Over time, of how…\n",
      "\n",
      "278: [Alex Marasigan] Um, not just…\n",
      "\n",
      "279: [Alex Marasigan] Wait a minute, miles per gallon?\n",
      "\n",
      "280: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm. Right?\n",
      "\n",
      "281: [Alex Marasigan] Oh, oh, wait, that makes sense. Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "282: [Alex Marasigan] Oh, okay. It showed this…\n",
      "\n",
      "283: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "284: [Alex Marasigan] And also, um…\n",
      "\n",
      "285: [Alex Marasigan] like, how…\n",
      "\n",
      "286: [Alex Marasigan] like, different models, so, like…\n",
      "\n",
      "287: [Alex Marasigan] I don't know what the VW is, but Volks… Volkswagen…\n",
      "\n",
      "288: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "289: [Alex Marasigan] in, like, a Toyota.\n",
      "\n",
      "290: [Alex Marasigan] it'll show another line like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "291: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm, so…\n",
      "\n",
      "292: [Chifang Chou] So your problem right now is that you don't know how to prime like this, or?\n",
      "\n",
      "293: [Alex Marasigan] Is that what?\n",
      "\n",
      "294: [Chifang Chou] So, what's your, like, the problem that you're facing right now, like…\n",
      "\n",
      "295: [Alex Marasigan] Um…\n",
      "\n",
      "296: [Alex Marasigan] it… I guess it interpreted it, like,\n",
      "\n",
      "297: [Alex Marasigan] Um, it didn't lump together, um, all the Volkswagen together, because they're different models.\n",
      "\n",
      "298: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm. Oh, okay. Then you can just, like, directly… say that what you think is wrong, or, like, what things you improve to ChatGPTs?\n",
      "\n",
      "299: [Alex Marasigan] Excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "300: [Alex Marasigan] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "301: [Chifang Chou] Yeah, just… if you… if it's your own work, that when you're doing homework, like, you face this kind of problems, what would you prompt? Just… Think like this. Don't be so stressed about, like, the user study.\n",
      "\n",
      "302: [Alex Marasigan] Mm-hmm. Um…\n",
      "\n",
      "303: [Alex Marasigan] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "304: [Alex Marasigan] That's a lot of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "305: [Chifang Chou] Okay, so if you're satisfied with it, we can go.\n",
      "\n",
      "306: [Chifang Chou] Uh, onto the survey. If you're not, you can keep prompting, it's up to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "307: [Alex Marasigan] Oops. There's a lot of lines, um…\n",
      "\n",
      "308: [Alex Marasigan] Maybe, like…\n",
      "\n",
      "309: [Alex Marasigan] There's one that's called High.\n",
      "\n",
      "310: [Alex Marasigan] Let's see…\n",
      "\n",
      "311: [Alex Marasigan] origin?\n",
      "\n",
      "312: [Alex Marasigan] Oh, okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "313: [Alex Marasigan] Okay, I'm gonna… I'm gonna try again.\n",
      "\n",
      "314: [Chifang Chou] Okay, take your time.\n",
      "\n",
      "315: [Alex Marasigan] Wait, what?\n",
      "\n",
      "316: [Alex Marasigan] Um…\n",
      "\n",
      "317: [Chifang Chou] That's so interesting that I want to go back to my own scenario file to take a look.\n",
      "\n",
      "318: [Alex Marasigan] It's, um… yeah, it's, um…\n",
      "\n",
      "319: [Alex Marasigan] Something, eh…\n",
      "\n",
      "320: [Alex Marasigan] Let's see…\n",
      "\n",
      "321: [Alex Marasigan] What happens if I'm not satisfied? What if I use the rest of the time to keep on prompting this?\n",
      "\n",
      "322: [Chifang Chou] Oh. Okay, so, um… I guess… You still need to, like, pick one.\n",
      "\n",
      "323: [Chifang Chou] Grab that if you feel like the most satisfied with, to fit the scenario, maybe.\n",
      "\n",
      "324: [Chifang Chou] You can go back to the scenario again and to check that if what things are they actually emphasizing on.\n",
      "\n",
      "325: [Chifang Chou] Instead, I guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "326: [Alex Marasigan] Okay, um…\n",
      "\n",
      "327: [Chifang Chou] Yeah, and there's a survey that will ask you that how clear and how can you interpret, right? You can, um… reflected on the survey as well, so don't worry.\n",
      "\n",
      "328: [Alex Marasigan] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "329: [Alex Marasigan] Um…\n",
      "\n",
      "330: [Alex Marasigan] And this one is not the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "331: [Alex Marasigan] But… it goes off the thumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "332: [Alex Marasigan] But I think I… I… I might be able to understand it.\n",
      "\n",
      "333: [Alex Marasigan] best.\n",
      "\n",
      "334: [Alex Marasigan] Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "335: [Chifang Chou] go with it to the survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "336: [Alex Marasigan] Uh, and then I just described the relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "337: [Chifang Chou] Yeah, the insights that you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "338: [Alex Marasigan] Okay, um…\n",
      "\n",
      "339: [Alex Marasigan] Alright, zoom this in.\n",
      "\n",
      "340: [Alex Marasigan] Oh, okay, bit too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "341: [Alex Marasigan] Okay, um, I'm noticing…\n",
      "\n",

      "434: [Alex Marasigan] The mean?\n",

      "435: [Alex Marasigan] Um, yeah.\n",

      "436: [Chifang Chou] Okay, so, uh, just a quick interview as well, can you just talk really shortly about your insights first?\n",
      "\n",
      "437: [Alex Marasigan] Uh, insights, so it's kind of hard to tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "438: [Alex Marasigan] the difference between, um, miles per gallon and the acceleration for the three regions.\n",

      "439: [Alex Marasigan] Um, but I think it's pretty obvious that…\n",
      "\n",
      "440: [Alex Marasigan] horsepower, um, the US has a much wider range, and also, like,\n",
      "\n",
      "441: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "442: [Alex Marasigan] generally, um, higher horsepower.\n",

      "443: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm. Okay, sounds good.\n",
      "\n",
      "444: [Alex Marasigan] Um, than the other two regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "445: [Chifang Chou] And, um, for the questions that you just answered, uh, probably just.\n",
      "\n",
      "446: [Chifang Chou] Focus on the third one. It's easy to read and interpret the chart's visual elements, axes, scales, copies, etc.\n",

      "448: [Alex Marasigan] Well, I just feel like it's…\n",
      "\n",
      "449: [Alex Marasigan] Um, it's kinda hard to compare.\n",
      "\n",
      "450: [Alex Marasigan] uh, the miles per gallon and acceleration.\n",
      "\n",
      "451: [Alex Marasigan] Because, uh, I guess, like,\n",
      "\n",
      "452: [Alex Marasigan] Uh, it would be nice to have a zoomed-in version of that, because I low-key kind of feel the horsepower is, like,\n",
      "\n",
      "453: [Alex Marasigan] Taking up too much space.\n",
      "\n",
      "454: [Alex Marasigan] Um, so it's harder to see which value\n",
      "\n",
      "455: [Alex Marasigan] is, like, better and bigger across the regions for…\n",

      "456: [Alex Marasigan] miles per gallon and acceleration.\n",
      "\n",
      "457: [Chifang Chou] Mmm, okay, I see. Then you can click the button, uh, the, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "458: [Chifang Chou] And that's the final survey that we're going to do based on.\n",
      "\n",
      "459: [Chifang Chou] Your, um, personal experience for today's study and after that we'll have a really short interview as well, so.\n",

      "\n",
      "461: [Alex Marasigan] Um, so I just finished this, and then…\n",
      "\n",
      "462: [Chifang Chou] Yeah, just finished this and stay here, and I will ask you some questions based on your answers.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "464: [Alex Marasigan] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "465: [Chifang Chou] Okay, so, um, based on your answers, can you, um, tell me that.\n",
      "\n",
      "466: [Chifang Chou] Uh, for the first question, what helped or limited your sense of faithfulness?\n",
      "\n",
      "467: [Alex Marasigan] Um, well, the first task went, uh, pretty well, but the second one…\n",
      "\n",
      "468: [Alex Marasigan] Um, I didn't, uh, quite get to the point where it was, like,\n",
      "\n",
      "469: [Alex Marasigan] Um, I, I got at the visualization that I wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "470: [Alex Marasigan] Um, and then for this one, I also, uh, couldn't, uh…\n",
      "\n",
      "471: [Alex Marasigan] It's not really, uh, up to, uh, scale, so…\n",
      "\n",
      "472: [Alex Marasigan] I…\n",
      "\n",
      "473: [Alex Marasigan] I didn't really get… didn't…\n",
      "\n",
      "474: [Alex Marasigan] really get the result that I wanted of the other two.\n",
      "\n",
      "475: [Chifang Chou] Okay. Mm-hmm. And for the second question, was there anything about AI interface or responses that made it easier or harder for you to use?\n",
      "\n",
      "476: [Alex Marasigan] Um… I feel like…\n",
      "\n",
      "477: [Alex Marasigan] It's… hmm…\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "481: [Alex Marasigan] It was…\n",
      "\n",
      "482: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "483: [Alex Marasigan] I… I feel like it's…\n",
      "\n",
      "484: [Alex Marasigan] I think it's just because of my lack of experience with, like, data visualization that I don't…\n",

      "\n",
      "487: [Alex Marasigan] I feel like if I knew that, and I had a background,\n",
      "\n",
      "488: [Alex Marasigan] in data visualization,\n",
      "\n",
      "489: [Alex Marasigan] It would have been more easier and intuitive.\n",

      "490: [Alex Marasigan] I'm sorry, I feel like it's less of, like, the AI and, like, modeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "491: [Chifang Chou] Okay. That's okay, okay, I see. And for the next question, can you tell me how did you react or handle, like, the times that system gave you, like, inconsistent or confusing outputs?\n",

      "492: [Alex Marasigan] Uh, sorry, could you repeat? Uh, could you repeat that?\n",

      "494: [Alex Marasigan] Um, I mean, I just tried again.\n",
      "\n",
      "495: [Alex Marasigan] Uh, except for, uh, I couldn't really get… quite get to, like, the…\n",
      "\n",
      "496: [Chifang Chou] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "497: [Alex Marasigan] a… like, a product that, like,\n",

      "498: [Alex Marasigan] Um, I'm satisfied with.\n",
      "\n",
      "499: [Alex Marasigan] Because of time. Um, so…\n",

      "500: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "501: [Alex Marasigan] Yeah, I think…\n",

      "504: [Alex Marasigan] Uh, especially, like, being more specific.\n",
      "\n",
      "505: [Chifang Chou] Okay. Mm-hmm, I see. And, uh, how did you decide when to… for you to trust or to question the charge generated by the AI?\n",
      "\n",
      "506: [Alex Marasigan] what I try to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "507: [Alex Marasigan] The what?\n",

      "511: [Alex Marasigan] If it's not understandable, I'm gonna question it.\n",

      "512: [Alex Marasigan] Um, and also, um…\n",
      "\n",
      "513: [Alex Marasigan] I mean, for the second one,\n",
      "\n",
      "514: [Alex Marasigan] It was understandable, but I… it didn't really… it also…\n",
      "\n",
      "515: [Alex Marasigan] uh, did not, like, fit my criteria of, like, what I imagined in my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "516: [Chifang Chou] Mmm, okay. Um, so, um, for the next question, um, can you tell me what would make you to trust the system more?\n",

      "517: [Alex Marasigan] Um… I feel like it… it just…\n",
      "\n",
      "518: [Alex Marasigan] Um, for me to trust it, I have to understand\n",

      "523: [Alex Marasigan] Um… I didn't really…\n",

      "524: [Alex Marasigan] Um, yeah, just…\n",
      "\n",
      "525: [Chifang Chou] So, somehow you do not trust it because you… do not, like, collect the data for yourself, I'll say that, because you're not, like.\n",

      "526: [Chifang Chou] You don't really understand the data?\n",

      "531: [Chifang Chou] Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "532: [Alex Marasigan] time, or if I had spent more time, like,\n",
